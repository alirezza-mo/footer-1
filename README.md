# hi 🖖, this is my first mini-project 🌓
A simple footer mini project with HTML ⚒️, CSS 🎨

---
<p>
  Well, as you can see, we used tools such as HTML and CSS in this footer, 
  maybe the appearance of the site is not good because I did not get a model from anywhere and I tried to implement most of the knowledge I learned. 
  Appearance is very important though. But for me now and for the first time it is more important.🍀
